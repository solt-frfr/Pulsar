# Credits
## [Aemulus Mod Manager](https://github.com/TekkaGB/AemulusModManager)
 Aemulus' Parallel Logging feature was used, and is a huge inspiration for this project.

## [Quasar](https://github.com/Mowjoh/Quasar)
 Quasar, the origianl SSBU mod manager. I tried looking at its code but none of it made sense to me. Their logo is used for one of the default previews.

## [83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1xCOsgWG0M)
 They drew the Hatsune Miku image used in one of the default previews.

## [oceanstuck](https://github.com/oceanstuck)
 Based person who gave me the name for this.

## [Atmosphere-NX](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)
 CFW for the Nintendo Switch. Their background is used for one of the default previews.

## Should any one of these people wish for me to remove their work from my project, I will happily oblige.
