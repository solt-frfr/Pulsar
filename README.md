# Credits
## [Aemulus Mod Manager](https://github.com/TekkaGB/AemulusModManager)
 Aemulus' Parallel Logging feature was used, and is a huge inspiration for this project.

## [Quasar](https://github.com/Mowjoh/Quasar)
 Quasar, the origianl SSBU mod manager. I looked at their code to find what the assign menu exactly did.
